            <p class="py-2">Are you in search of this? In terms of Web design, <a class="text-indigo-600" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)">the "holy grail" is
            page layout</a> that has 3 columns. It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in which it could be 
            implemented with available technologies all had drawbacks. Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to searching 
            for the elusive Holy Grail.
            <p class="py-2">
            As of 2021, the Holy Grail layout is implemented using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid display. For this example, we're using
            the <a class="text-indigo-600" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> utility framework. As part of it's default classes, Tailwind includes
            <a class="text-indigo-600" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction">Flexbox classes</a> which make this implementation possible. The holy grail 
            example is also responsive so that the layout stacks vertically on smaller mobile screens.

            Many web pages require a layout with multiple (often three) columns, with the 
            main page content in one column (often the center), and supplementary content such as menus 
            and advertisements in the other columns (sidebars). These columns commonly require separate 
            backgrounds, with borders between them, and should appear to be the same height no matter 
            which column has the tallest content. A common requirement is that the sidebars have a fixed width, 
            with the center column adjusting in size to fill the window (fluid or liquid layout). 
            Another requirement is that, when a page does not contain enough content to fill the screen, 
            the footer should drop to the bottom of the browser window instead of leaving blank space underneath.
